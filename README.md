## Overview

Welcome to the Library Management System (LMS)! This application is designed to help manage and organize a library's book and student records. With a user-friendly interface, LMS makes it simple to add, modify, delete, and view records for both books and students.

## Features

- **Manage Books**: Add new books, update existing ones, and remove old records.
- **Manage Students**: Create student records, update their details, and manage their library activities.
- **Issue and Return Books**: Easily issue books to students and manage returns.
- **View Records**: Check out details of all books and students in the system.
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific books or student records.
